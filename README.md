## Why I Built This 

I'm a solo developer. I don't write code — Claude Code does.

Other spec-driven development tools exist; BMAD, Speckit... But they all seem to make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you're building. I'm not a 50-person software company. I don't want to play enterprise theater. I'm just a creative person trying to build great things that work.

So I built GSD. The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.

The system gives OpenCode everything it needs to do the work *and* verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.

That's what this is. No enterprise roleplay bullshit. Just an incredibly effective system for building cool stuff consistently using OpenCode.

## From translator...

I just love both GSD and OpenCode. I felt like having GSD available only for Claude Code is not fair.

Vibecoding has a bad reputation. You describe what you want, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent garbage that falls apart at scale.

GSD fixes that. It's the context engineering layer that makes OpenCode reliable. Describe your idea, let the system extract everything it needs to know, and let OpenCode get to work.

---

## Who This Is For

People who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they're running a 50-person engineering org.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npx gsd-opencode
```

That's it. Verify with `/gsd:help`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Non-interactive Install (Docker, CI, Scripts)</strong></summary>

```bash
npx gsd-opencode --global   # Install to ~/.config/opencode/
npx gsd-opencode --local    # Install to .opencode/
```

Use `--global` (`-g`) or `--local` (`-l`) to skip the interactive prompt.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Development Installation</strong></summary>

Clone the repository and run the installer locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rokicool/gsd-opencode.git
cd gsd-opencode
node bin/install.js --local
```

Installs to `.opencode/` for testing modifications before contributing.

</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: Granular Permissions</strong></summary>

If you prefer not to use that flag, add this to your project's `.opencode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(date:*)",
      "Bash(echo:*)",
      "Bash(cat:*)",
      "Bash(ls:*)",
      "Bash(mkdir:*)",
      "Bash(wc:*)",
      "Bash(head:*)",
      "Bash(tail:*)",
      "Bash(sort:*)",
      "Bash(grep:*)",
      "Bash(tr:*)",
      "Bash(git add:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(git status:*)",
      "Bash(git log:*)",
      "Bash(git diff:*)",
      "Bash(git tag:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

## How It Works

### 1. Start with an idea

```
/gsd:new-project
```

The system asks questions. Keeps asking until it has everything — your goals, constraints, tech preferences, edge cases. You go back and forth until the idea is fully captured. Creates **PROJECT.md**.

### 2. Create roadmap

```
/gsd:create-roadmap
```

Produces:
- **ROADMAP.md** — Phases from start to finish
- **STATE.md** — Living memory that persists across sessions

### 3. Plan and execute phases

```
/gsd:plan-phase 1      # System creates atomic task plans
/gsd:execute-plan      # Subagent implements autonomously
```

Each phase breaks into 2-3 atomic tasks. Each task runs in a fresh subagent context — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero degradation.

### 4. Ship and iterate

```
/gsd:complete-milestone   # Archive v1, prep for v2
/gsd:add-phase            # Append new work
/gsd:insert-phase 2       # Slip urgent work between phases
```

Ship your MVP in a day. Add features. Insert hotfixes. The system stays modular — you're never stuck.

---

## Existing Projects (Brownfield)

Already have code? Start here instead.

### 1. Map the codebase

```
/gsd:map-codebase
```

Spawns parallel agents to analyze your code. Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 documents:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `STACK.md` | Languages, frameworks, dependencies |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Patterns, layers, data flow |
| `STRUCTURE.md` | Directory layout, where things live |
| `CONVENTIONS.md` | Code style, naming patterns |
| `TESTING.md` | Test framework, patterns |
| `INTEGRATIONS.md` | External services, APIs |
| `CONCERNS.md` | Tech debt, known issues, fragile areas |

### 2. Initialize project

```
/gsd:new-project
```

Same as greenfield, but the system knows your codebase. Questions focus on what you're adding/changing, not starting from scratch.

### 3. Continue as normal

From here, it's the same: `/gsd:create-roadmap` → `/gsd:plan-phase` → `/gsd:execute-plan`

The codebase docs load automatically during planning. OpenCode knows your patterns, conventions, and where to put things.

## Why It Works

### Context Engineering

OpenCode is incredibly powerful *if* you give it the context it needs. Most people don't.

GSD handles it for you:

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, always loaded |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Where you're going, what's done |
| `STATE.md` | Decisions, blockers, position — memory across sessions |
| `PLAN.md` | Atomic task with XML structure, verification steps |
| `SUMMARY.md` | What happened, what changed, committed to history |
| `ISSUES.md` | Deferred enhancements tracked across sessions |

Size limits based on where OpenCode's quality degrades. Stay under, get consistent excellence.

### XML Prompt Formatting

Every plan is structured XML optimized for OpenCode:

```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Create login endpoint</name>
  <files>src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts</files>
  <action>
    Use jose for JWT (not jsonwebtoken - CommonJS issues).
    Validate credentials against users table.
    Return httpOnly cookie on success.
  </action>
  <verify>curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie</verify>
  <done>Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401</done>
</task>
```

Precise instructions. No guessing. Verification built in.

### Subagent Execution

As OpenCode fills its context window, quality degrades. You've seen it: *"Due to context limits, I'll be more concise now."* That "concision" is code for cutting corners.

GSD prevents this. Each plan is maximum 3 tasks. Each plan runs in a fresh subagent — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero accumulated garbage.

| Task | Context | Quality |
|------|---------|---------|
| Task 1 | Fresh | ✅ Full |
| Task 2 | Fresh | ✅ Full |
| Task 3 | Fresh | ✅ Full |

No degradation. Walk away, come back to completed work.

### Atomic Git Commits

Each task gets its own commit immediately after completion:

```bash
abc123f docs(08-02): complete user registration plan
def456g feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow
hij789k feat(08-02): implement password hashing
lmn012o feat(08-02): create registration endpoint
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Benefits:** Git bisect finds exact failing task. Each task independently revertable. Clear history for OpenCode in future sessions. Better observability in AI-automated workflow.

Every commit is surgical, traceable, and meaningful.

### Modular by Design

- Add phases to current milestone
- Insert urgent work between phases
- Complete milestones and start fresh
- Adjust plans without rebuilding everything

You're never locked in. The system adapts.
